  Context Management Strategy

  You're right to be concerned. Here's my recommendation:

  Approach: Batched Implementation with Fresh Contexts

  Work in 4 batches with checkpoint documents between them:

  Batch 1: Foundation (Phases 0-2) - ~4 days
  - Test infrastructure
  - Core data structures (Peer, PeerStore)
  - Configuration
  - Checkpoint: Create docs/p2p_checkpoint_1_foundation.md

  Batch 2: Protocol (Phases 3-4) - ~8-10 days
  - Handshake implementation
  - Connection actor & state machine
  - Checkpoint: Create docs/p2p_checkpoint_2_protocol.md

  Batch 3: Orchestration (Phases 5-6) - ~7-8 days
  - Manager implementation
  - DNS discovery
  - Checkpoint: Create docs/p2p_checkpoint_3_orchestration.md

  Batch 4: Completion (Phases 7-11) - ~7-9 days
  - Messages, observability, public API
  - Final testing and documentation
  - Checkpoint: Create docs/p2p_checkpoint_4_completion.md

  Between Batches Workflow

  1. I create a checkpoint document summarizing:
    - What was implemented
    - Key files and their purpose
    - Test coverage achieved
    - Any design decisions made
    - What's next
  2. You commit the code
  3. Start fresh conversation for next batch
  4. In new context, you say: "Continue P2P implementation, starting Batch N. See docs/p2p_implementation_plan.md and docs/p2p_checkpoint_X.md"
  5. I read checkpoint + plan, continue from there

  Why This Works

  ✅ Each batch is self-contained enough to fit in one context✅ Checkpoints prevent information loss between contexts✅ Fresh context = full token budget for next batch✅ Natural breaking points
  align with implementation phases✅ You maintain continuity through git commits

  Alternative: Continue in One Context

  We could try to complete all phases in this context if:
  - We're very selective about what code we read
  - We use the Task tool to offload some work to agents
  - We accept risk of running out of tokens partway through

  But I recommend the batched approach for quality and manageability.
